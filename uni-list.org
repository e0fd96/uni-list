* Introduction
This is a list of UK Universities with academics in Buddhist Studies and related areas providing their research interests. It also includes BA and MA programmes or modules in Buddhist studies, (including modules that have a significant Buddhist content). Also included is an indication of UK course provision for the learning of Sanskrit, Pali and Tibetan languages, as these are largely engaged in for the purpose of research or reading of Buddhist texts. Although not specified separately, where academic staff have the relevant expertise, proposals for doctoral research in Buddhist Studies may be welcomed.

Updates and suggestions can be sent to Ilmari Koria via [[mailto:ilmarikoria@posteo.net][ilmarikoria@posteo.net]]
